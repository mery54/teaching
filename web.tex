\section{Using  the Event-B modelling language  for teaching verification 
techniques }

Verification of program properties such as partial correctness (PC) or
absence of errors at runtime (RTE) applies induction principles using
algorithmic techniques for checking statements in a logical framework
such as classical logic or temporal logic.  Alan Turing was
undoubtedly the first to annotate programs, namely Turing machines,
and to apply an induction principle to transition systems.  Our work
is placed in this perspective of verifying safety properties of
sequential or distributed programs, with the aim of presenting them as
simply as possible to student classes in the context of a posteriori
verification.  We report on an in vivo experiment using the Event-B
language and associated tools as an assembly and disassembly platform
for correcting programs in a programming language.  We revisit the
properties of partial correctness and the absence of run-time errors
in the context of this experiment, which precedes the use of Event-B as a method of correct design by construction.  We have adopted a contract-based approach to programming, which we are implementing with Event-B.  A few examples are given to illustrate this pedagogical approach.  This step is part of a process of learning both the underlying techniques and other tools such as Frama-c, Dafny and Why3 \ldots, which are based on the same ideas.

\section{ Course DISCONT  Modelling Modelling Systems}
\label{sec:course-mosos-modell}


The   course   Modelling Modelling Systems  (DISCONT) is taught in
the Master  in Computer Science of the University of Lorraine  and in
the Master in Computer Engineering of Telecom Nancy. The  lectures notes  and documents for the students  are  at the link

been designed  in the ANR project DISCONT  and it has been taught two
times  for assessing it.
