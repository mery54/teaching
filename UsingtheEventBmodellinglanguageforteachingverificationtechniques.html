<!-- l. 122 --><p class='noindent'>Verification of program properties such as partial correctness (PC) or absence of errors at
runtime (RTE) applies induction principles using algorithmic techniques for checking statements
in a logical framework such as classical logic or temporal logic. Alan Turing was undoubtedly
the first to annotate programs, namely Turing machines, and to apply an induction principle to
transition systems. Our work is placed in this perspective of verifying safety properties
of sequential or distributed programs, with the aim of presenting them as simply
as possible to student classes in the context of a posteriori verification. We report
on an in vivo experiment using the language and associated tools as an assembly
and disassembly platform for correcting programs in a programming language. We
revisit the properties of partial correctness and the absence of run-time errors in the
context of this experiment, which precedes the use of as a method of correct design by
construction. We have adopted a contract-based approach to programming, which we are
implementing with Event-B. A few examples are given to illustrate this pedagogical
approach. This step is part of a process of learning both the underlying techniques
and other tools such as Frama-c, Dafny and Why3 â€¦, which are based on the same
ideas.
